This is a test note to demonstrate alphabetical sorting of categories and subcategories.

```tagtable
level1: area
level2: category
level3: subcategory
```

This should display categories in alphabetical order:
1. Alpha
2. Beta  
3. Zebra

And within each category, subcategories should be sorted alphabetically:
- abc
- def
- xyz

Note: "Uncategorized" categories and empty subcategories will appear first in their respective lists.
